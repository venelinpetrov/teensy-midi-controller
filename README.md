# Teensy 2.0 as USB MIDI device.

## Description

First class 2-channel MIDI controller prototype for mixing music in real time. Compatible with any DAW, but there is a mapping for Ableton Live that is in a [separate repository](https://github.com/venelinpetrov/teensy-midi-controller-driver).

## Features

Each channel has 3 encoders, 1 fader and 3 lit buttons (see the schematics folder). This is a common setup and can be expanded to any number of channels

## Additionally

- There is a [separate library](https://github.com/venelinpetrov/sreg) for working with shift registers (74HC595)
- MIDI mapping (driver) for Ableton Live in a [separate repo](https://github.com/venelinpetrov/teensy-midi-controller-driver)
